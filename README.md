# E-commerce Churn Analysis

In this project, the Tableau dashboard is utilised to visualise an e-commerce dataset obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction). 

The dataset belongs to a leading online e-commerce company which is a registered non-store online retailer. The company mainly sells fashion, groceries, laptops and accessories, mobile, and mobile phones.

<b>Business Problems</b>

The company have been losing quite a number of customers since they started their business. In order to maintain the position of being the leading online e-commerce company and to maximise their profits, the company wants to investigate the reasons for the customers to leave and take precaution measures to prevent more current existing customers from leaving. Therefore, the Tableau visualisation tool is utilised to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and recommendations are given in this project.
